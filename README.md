# üê± Veterinary Clinic Management System üê∂

## Overview üí°
This web-based application is designed to assist small veterinary clinics in managing basic information related to their clients and pets. The software targets small vet clinics and aims to provide functionalities such as login/logout, registration, and simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing client and pet information.

## Local Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
As this project is hosted on PythonAnywhere, it's not directly cloneable in the traditional sense, but you can set it up locally for development or testing purposes. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```console
git clone https://github.com/jenschrader/django-crm.git
```
### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment: 
Navigate to the project directory and set up a virtual environment so that dependencies are isolated:
```console
cd vet-clinic-crm
python -m venv env
```
### 3. Activate the Virtual Environment:
Commands may differ depending on your machine or preferred terminal/console. We use GitBash - the following command works for GitBash consoles:
```console
source env/scripts/activate
```
### 4. Install Dependencies:
Using pip, install the requirements.txt file:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 5. Modify Local Settings:
**Note: Make sure to have MySql installed on your machine. You will need to set up your local database before modifying.**
To configure the project to target locally, you must modify the `settings.py` file. Here is an example of what code to alter:
```python
DEBUG = True

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1']

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'your_local_database_name',
        'USER': 'your_database_username',
        'PASSWORD': 'your_database_password',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}

MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static')
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
```
### 6. Migrate Database:
Run migrations to set up your local database schema:
```console
python manage.py migrate
```
### 7. Create Superuser (Optional):
If you want to access the Django admin interface locally, create a superuser:
```console
manage.py createsuperuser
```
### 8. Run the Development Server:
Finally, you can start the Django project by running the following command:
```console
python manage.py runserver
```
Once running, you can access the application by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
